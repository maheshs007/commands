# Kubernetes API Server HTTP Errors and Their Reasons

As a Kubernetes administrator with over 5+ years of experience, Iâ€™ve encountered and resolved many common API server errors. These errors often arise from misconfigurations, misunderstandings, or operational issues. Logging and checking Kubernetes events is fundamental for effective troubleshooting in Kubernetes administration. Here's a guide to help you navigate through common errors and their causes.

## Common Kubernetes API Server HTTP Errors

### 401 Unauthorized
**Reason:** Authentication failed.  
This happens when the API server cannot verify the identity of the requester.

**Possible Causes:**
- Invalid or expired service account token.
- Incorrect client certificate or missing certificate authority (CA).
- OIDC token misconfiguration (e.g., wrong issuer or audience).
- `kubectl` is using an outdated or misconfigured `kubeconfig` file.

**My Observations:**
- Many times, misconfigured service account tokens in CI/CD pipelines cause 401 errors. Ensuring tokens are rotated and correctly assigned is critical.
- Always check API server logs (`/var/log/kube-apiserver.log`) for detailed error information.

---

### 403 Forbidden
**Reason:** Authorization denied.  
The API server verified the identity but determined the requester lacks the necessary permissions.

**Possible Causes:**
- Insufficient RBAC roles or role bindings for the user or service account.
- Trying to perform actions in a namespace without proper permissions.
- Using a `ClusterRole` or `Role` that doesn't cover the requested resource or verb.

**My Observations:**
- Misconfigured RBAC is one of the most frequent causes of issues, especially when deploying third-party tools or granting access to new team members.
- Regularly audit your RBAC policies using tools like `kubectl auth can-i` or `kubectl describe roles`.

---

### 404 Not Found
**Reason:** Requested resource or endpoint not found.  

**Possible Causes:**
- Typo in the resource name or namespace in the `kubectl` command.
- Referring to a resource that does not exist (e.g., non-existent `ConfigMap` or `Pod`).
- Trying to use a deprecated or unavailable API version.

**My Observations:**
- Deprecated API versions in older manifests frequently cause this error, especially after Kubernetes upgrades. Keeping manifests updated with supported API versions is essential.

---

### 422 Unprocessable Entity
**Reason:** Request is syntactically correct but semantically invalid.  

**Possible Causes:**
- Invalid YAML or JSON file structure.
- Resource quota exceeded (e.g., trying to create more pods than allowed).
- Failing validation rules (e.g., naming conventions or constraints).

**My Observations:**
- YAML indentation errors are common. Always validate manifests using `kubectl apply --dry-run=client` or tools like `yamllint`.
- Resource quotas often catch new teams off guard, especially in multi-tenant clusters.

---

### 500 Internal Server Error
**Reason:** A server-side issue occurred while processing the request.  

**Possible Causes:**
- Misconfigured Kubernetes component (e.g., controller-manager, scheduler).
- Cluster is in an unhealthy state (e.g., etcd issues or API server overload).
- Resource state inconsistencies due to node or component failures.

**My Observations:**
- High API server CPU or memory usage, often caused by excessive requests or a noisy tenant, can lead to this error. Monitoring API server health is crucial.

---

### 503 Service Unavailable
**Reason:** The API server is temporarily unavailable to process requests.  

**Possible Causes:**
- High CPU or memory usage on the API server.
- Issues with etcd, leading to degraded API server performance.
- Network issues between `kubectl` and the API server.
- During upgrades or restarts of the API server.

**My Observations:**
- Etcd health directly impacts API server availability. Always ensure etcd has sufficient resources and backups.
- During high-traffic scenarios, rate-limiting or scaling the API server helps mitigate these issues.

## Daily Faced Errors and Their Root Causes

### 1. `kubectl get pods` returns `404`
- **Cause:** The namespace was not specified or does not exist.
- **Fix:** Use `-n <namespace>` or check the namespace with `kubectl get namespaces`.

---

### 2. `kubectl apply` fails with `422 Unprocessable Entity`
- **Cause:** Incorrect indentation or invalid syntax in the YAML file.
- **Fix:** Validate the YAML with tools like `yamllint` or `kubectl apply --dry-run=client`.

---

### 3. `kubectl exec` returns `403 Forbidden`
- **Cause:** The service account tied to the pod lacks RBAC permissions for `exec`.
- **Fix:** Add proper role bindings to the service account.

---

### 4. `kubectl logs` returns `403 Forbidden`
- **Cause:** Insufficient RBAC permissions for `pods/log`.
- **Fix:** Update the user's role or role binding to include `pods/log` permissions.

---

### 5. `kubectl describe` shows `ImagePullBackOff`
- **Cause:** Kubernetes cannot pull the container image.
- **Fix:** Verify image name, tag, and container registry credentials.

---

### 6. `kubectl get nodes` shows `NotReady`
- **Cause:** Node is unhealthy or kubelet cannot communicate with the API server.
- **Fix:** Check node status with `journalctl` or `kubectl describe node`.

---

### 7. `kubectl apply` fails with `409 Conflict`
- **Cause:** A resource already exists with conflicting definitions.
- **Fix:** Use `kubectl replace` or delete the resource before reapplying.

## Key Advice for Troubleshooting
1. **Check Events:** Use `kubectl get events` or `kubectl describe` commands to investigate cluster-level events.
2. **Enable Logging:** Review logs from key components like the API server, kubelet, controller-manager, and scheduler for detailed insights.
3. **Monitor Resources:** Always monitor resource usage (CPU, memory) of cluster components and nodes to prevent resource exhaustion.
4. **Validate YAML:** Always validate YAML manifests before applying them to avoid runtime errors.
5. **Audit Permissions:** Regularly review RBAC policies to ensure the principle of least privilege is followed.

Logging and event monitoring are the foundational tools for effective Kubernetes administration. Stay proactive by continuously improving cluster observability and maintaining a healthy cluster environment.
